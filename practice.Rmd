## Scientific names

In biology, Genus and Species names are *italicised* but higher taxonomic levels and the name of the authority are not this frequent leads to errors by students (and staff)

This means that for the scarabead species *Something something*

Alternatively as list
* Something
* Something
* Something
* Something


### *Proagaderus something*
This specie has spectacularly particular horns. There is a picture here ![Image picture](images/IMG_20220524_181113_2.jpg) which you can see below



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Some useful chunk options

* `fig.width = XX`, `fig.height = YY` set figure size in inches
* `fig.cap = figure caption` generates a figure caption
* `comment = NA` turn off the ## symbols that appear at the start of any text output
* `warning = FALSE` don't include warnings
* `message = FALSE` don't include messages
* `tidy = TRUE` try to stop long lines of code spilling over the edge
* `eval = FALSE` try to stop long lines of code spilling over the edge

NB the chunk header must be on a single line (which  can be of any length).



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
 knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4)
```

### Adding Maths

You can add maths to an R markdown document by using Latex maths annotation:

$$ \sum \left(x - \bar{x} \right)^2 $$
A more complex example

$$ \LARGE s^2 = \frac{\sum \left(x - \bar{x} \right)^2}{n-1} $$
